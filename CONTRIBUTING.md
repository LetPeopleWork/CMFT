# Contributing to Lighthouse
We develop Ligththouse as an OpenSource project, so that people can actively contribute. There are many different ways that you can contribute, not only via writing code.

Below is a list of ways how you could support Ligthhouse.

## Issues
If you have a feature request or found a potential bug, please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/Lighthouse/issues). When doing so, please describe it in as much detail as possible.

Please also check out the existing issues already, so we don't have duplicates.

## Become a Pilot User
While we're adding new functionality, we're always looking for people that are willing to spend some time in trying things out and give us feedback on a regular base. If you are willing to occasionally run into some errors in return for being at the bleeding edge of the development, [reach out](mailto:contact@letpeople.work).

## Documentation
While we do our best to keep the docs up to date, it's not always possible (and honestly, it's not the most fun part either :-). So if you find some typos, outdated sections or just plain wrong parts, feel free to update them.
If you have no experience with Github, feel free to [reach out](mailto:contact@letpeople.work) to us and we are happy to guide you through how it works.

## Code
While we mentioned that there are other ways than contributing code, the code still needs to be written. So if you are willing to contribute here, you are very welcome. We recommend to [reach out](mailto:contact@letpeople.work) before you start with adjusting the code, so we can make sure it makes sense what you work on.

Feel free to browse through the [Good First Issues](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/Lighthouse/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and have a look at what might be there.

You can also see the next issues we prioritized in our [Project Overview](https://github.com/orgs/LetPeopleWork/projects/3/views/2).

Last but not least, you can also propose things where you want to contribute. After all, it's your time and it should be meaningful to you. We're always happy if we can improve, especially on the Frontend side of things. Go ahead, check out the code and make a proposal on how you would like to contribute. Once you have a proposal, [connect with us](mailto:contact@letpeople.work) to discuss details.

We appreciate any contribution, but also want to make you aware that we reserve the right to decline certain changes. Thus, if you don't work on any of the prioritized issues, please always double check with us first. Otherwise it might lead to wasted work.
