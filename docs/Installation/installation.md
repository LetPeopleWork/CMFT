# Installation
Lighthouse is a web application, that is foreseen to run on a server where multiple people have access to it. You can however run it also on your local machine. This might be the preferred option for now, as there is no User Management, nor any authentication/authorization at this point.

Lighthouse can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, as well as within a docker environment.

In the following pages you find instructions how to run Lighthouse directly on your [Operating System](./standard.html) and via [Docker](./docker.html).

# Configuration
Once you have successfully installed Lighthouse, check out the [Configuration Options](./configuration.html) to see all configuration options (like using custom certificates).
