# Installing Lighthouse

Lighthouse offers two main installation methods to suit different needs:

## [Docker Installation](docker.md)
Recommended for most users - offers the simplest setup and management.

## [Standard Installation](standard.md)
Traditional installation directly on your system, suitable for environments where Docker isn't available.

## Prerequisites for All Installations

Both installation methods require:
- At least 1GB RAM
- 500MB disk space
- Network access for work item tracking integration
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
