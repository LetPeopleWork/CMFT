# Contributions
If you find something that can be improved in the documentation, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/Lighthouse/issues/new?template=documentation-improvement.yml){:target="_blank"} in our GitHub repository. An issue can be as small as a typo, but also wrong or outdated sections, as well as something that we've might have missed so far.

If you want to do more than just reporting, we're happy to onboard people that help us improve our docs. Please reach out to use if you are interested in this.
